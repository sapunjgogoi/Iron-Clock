🤖 J.A.R.V.I.S. HUD Digital Clock
A sleek, high-performance digital timepiece inspired by the Stark Industries Mark 85 Heads-Up Display (HUD). This project transforms a standard browser window into a futuristic Arc Reactor interface, complete with real-time system data aesthetics and holographic animations.

🚀 Live Preview
The interface features a central Arc Reactor Core that pulses and rotates, housing the current time, date, and day, surrounded by "live" data telemetry panels.

✨ Features
Dynamic Timekeeping: High-precision clock updating every 1000ms.

Arc Reactor Core: CSS-animated rotating rings and a "breathing" light effect.

J.A.R.V.I.S. HUD: Corner data panels displaying mock system status (Power, Latency, Uplink).

Responsive Design: Centered layout using Flexbox that scales across different screen sizes.

Futuristic Aesthetic:

Typography: Powered by Google Fonts' Orbitron.

Color Palette: Deep Space Blue, Arc Cyan, and Stark Gold.

Scanline Effect: A periodic vertical scan animation for that "monitor" feel.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure for the HUD elements.

CSS3:

@keyframes for the rotation and pulsing animations.

Glassmorphism for the data panels.

Radial-gradients for the metallic armor depth.

JavaScript (Vanilla): For time calculation and DOM manipulation (no external libraries required).
